Running tests
=============

PubHub uses nodeunit to run its tests. Use npm to install nodeunit if you don't have it (it doesn't come packaged with PubHub):

```
npm install nodeunit
```

To perform the unit tests, run the following command from the root of your checkout:

```
nodeunit tests/TEST_FILE.js
```
